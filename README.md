Project Title: SuperStore Sales Analysis using Python

Conducted comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on SuperStore Orders dataset to understand sales performance and customer behavior.

Cleaned and preprocessed the data by handling incorrect data types, removing inconsistencies, and creating new time-based features such as Year and Month.

Analyzed sales and profit trends across categories, sub-categories, regions, and customer segments.

Visualized key insights using Matplotlib and Seaborn including monthly sales trends, category-wise sales, profit distribution, and discount vs profit analysis.

Identified top-performing product categories and regions, as well as loss-making segments caused by heavy discounts.

Provided data-driven insights to support business decision-making and improve profitability.
